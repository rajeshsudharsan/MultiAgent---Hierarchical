Management of Vitamin D Deficiency in Adults

1. Introduction
Vitamin D is essential for calcium and phosphate homeostasis, bone mineralization, and muscle function. Deficiency has been linked to osteoporosis, osteomalacia, increased fall and fracture risk, and potential extraskeletal effects on immune function and mood. This report outlines a structured approach to identifying, diagnosing, and managing vitamin D deficiency in adults.

2. Identification of At-Risk Adults
At-risk populations should be prioritized for screening and preventive measures. Key risk factors include:
  • Minimal sun exposure (indoor lifestyle, high latitude, extensive clothing coverage)  
  • Darker skin pigmentation (reduced cutaneous synthesis)  
  • Obesity (sequestration of vitamin D in adipose tissue)  
  • Malabsorption syndromes (celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, bariatric surgery)  
  • Chronic kidney disease or liver disease (impaired hydroxylation)  
  • Use of anticonvulsants (e.g., phenytoin, phenobarbital) or glucocorticoids (enhanced catabolism)

3. Diagnostic Confirmation
3.1 Serum 25-Hydroxyvitamin D
  • Deficiency: < 20 ng/mL  
  • Insufficiency: 20–30 ng/mL  
3.2 Additional Laboratory Tests
  • Serum calcium and phosphate (evaluate for hypocalcemia or phosphate imbalance)  
  • Parathyroid hormone (PTH) if secondary hyperparathyroidism is suspected  

4. Lifestyle Measures
4.1 Sensible Sun Exposure
  • 10–30 minutes of midday sun on arms and legs, 2–3 times per week  
  • Adjust duration based on skin type, UV index, and season  
4.2 Physical Activity
  • Weight-bearing exercises (walking, jogging, resistance training) to support bone density and muscle strength

5. Dietary Optimization
Include vitamin D–rich and fortified foods:
  • Fatty fish (salmon, mackerel, sardines)  
  • Fortified dairy and plant-based milks  
  • Egg yolks  
  • UV-exposed mushrooms

6. Supplementation Guidelines
6.1 Mild Deficiency (20–30 ng/mL)
  • 800–2,000 IU vitamin D3 daily  
6.2 Moderate to Severe Deficiency (<20 ng/mL)
  • Loading dose: 50,000 IU weekly for 6–8 weeks, then maintenance  
6.3 Special Considerations
  • Individualize dose based on baseline level, body weight, and comorbid conditions  
  • Administer with a meal containing fat to enhance absorption

7. Monitoring and Safety
  • Reassess serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D, calcium, phosphate 3 months after initiating therapy, then every 6–12 months  
  • Monitor for hypercalcemia (nausea, vomiting, polyuria, kidney stones)—particularly if 25(OH)D >150 ng/mL  

8. Addressing Related Health Concerns
8.1 Bone Health  
  • Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scanning if osteopenia/osteoporosis is suspected  
8.2 Muscle Strength and Fall Risk  
  • Functional assessment; consider referral to physical therapy for balance and strengthening exercises  
8.3 Extraskeletal Effects  
  • Be alert for increased infection risk and mood disturbances; coordinate management with primary care or relevant specialists

9. Summary
A systematic approach—targeted screening of at-risk individuals, laboratory confirmation, lifestyle and dietary optimization, appropriate dosing of supplementation, and vigilant monitoring—can effectively correct vitamin D deficiency and reduce associated health risks. Interdisciplinary coordination enhances patient outcomes.
